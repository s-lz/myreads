# MyReads Project

This is my version of the MyReads project. I coded the React functionalities as required in the project specifications.

## Slight variations
I have tweaked minor design things:

* changed the main color to purple to differentiate from the main Udacity project;
* changed header background and font;
* added header in a component to display it on all pages.
* changed the _None_ option in the Select to _Remove_
* added colors to the option lists
* added CSS animations to move and fade in books on appearance
* added CSS animations to move and fade out books when they are removed
